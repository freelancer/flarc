`flarc` is a
[[https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabcontrib/article/adding_new_classes/#creating-libraries |
libphutil library]] that contains various
[[https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist/ | Arcanist]]
extensions used at Freelancer.com, mostly relating to
[[https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist_extending_lint/ |
linting]] and testing integrations.

== Usage ==
To use `flarc`, you must clone the repository into a location that Arcanist
knows how to load it. Arcanist adjusts the PHP include path in
@{function:arcanist_adjust_php_include_path} so that libphutil libraries can
be loaded from any of the following locations:

  # A directory adjacent to `arcanist/` itself.
  # Anywhere in the normal PHP [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path | `include_path`]].
  # Inside `arcanist/externals/includes/`.

To load `flarc` so that it is available for use, add `flarc/src` to the `load`
path:

```lang=json, name=.arcconfig
{
  "load": ["flarc/src"]
}
```
